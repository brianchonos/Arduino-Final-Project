# Arduino-Final-Project
As my final, and best project for the arduino board, I hooked up a sensitive microphone to the board and played music into the mic. The arduino would read the volume and based on a set threshold, an rgb led light would blink various colors in correspondence with the beat of the music. A video is included.
